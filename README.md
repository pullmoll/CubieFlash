# CubieFlash

CubieFlash is a tool to flash the SLC NAND of the Cubietech Cubietruck, a.k.a. cubieboard3.

The code is based on Steven Saunderson's bootfix project, his ontact info can be found at http://phelum.net

Since Allwinner never released the source code for their flash utilities LiveSuit and/or PhoenixSuit, all code is based on reverse engineering the USB communications between these utilies and the Cubietruck in FEL mode.
